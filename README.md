# Luma Child Theme Starter Files (Magento 2)

These are the starter files that you will need in order to create your own Luma Child Theme. Once these starter files are in place, it will allow you to create customisations on top of the Luma theme that comes packaged with Magento 2.

Note: That this was created with Magento 2.3 in mind.

## Installation

1. Upload these files to the following Magento 2 directory: `app/design/frontend`
2. Update your theme in the Magento Backend: `Content > Design > Configuration > (Select Edit on your Store View) > Default Theme > Applied Theme > "Magento Luma Child"`
3. Clear Magento Cache: `System > Cache Management > Flush Magento Cache`

Now any changes you make to your child theme will be reflected on the Frontend
